# ResumeBuilder
ServiceNow application to quickly build a resume.

PURPOSE : 
Provide an application to build and track resumes. The Build Resume catalog item will take in a number of variables to quickly put together resume data, and provide a downloadable copy of the complete resume.

AUDIENCE : 
ServiceNow Administrators can user this app to create the custom application in their own instance, complete with catalog item.

USE :
Once the application is installed, and the catalog item is enabled on an intance portal, end users can provide values for variables and create a resume from the catalog item.

NOTES :
- Admins : Customise this to your needs once you have it in your instance! Use your imagination -- I'm sure there are plenty of fancy things than can be done with this app.
- While I'd appreciate props for building this, it really is yours. I wanted to provide some ground work for creating resumes to eliminate some of the tedium.
